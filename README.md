- **Smart Suggestions**: Automated relationship type detection

### ðŸ’¾ Data Management
- **Export Options**: Save data as JSON or formatted HTML reports
- **Backup System**: Create and restore from backups
- **Data Merging**: Combine duplicate person records
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required packages:

```bash
pip install tkinter networkx scikit-learn numpy matplotlib geopy openai
```

### Running the Application

```bash
python Bgraph_1415.py
```

## Usage

### Loading Data
1. Use **"Open File"** to load individual text files
2. Use **"Open Folder"** to process all text files in a directory
3. Data is automatically parsed and relationships are established

### Exploring Relationships
1. Select a person from the list to view their details
2. Click **"Show Relations"** to visualize their network
3. Use right-click context menus for advanced operations
4. Navigate the graph with mouse controls:
   - **Left-click + drag**: Pan
   - **Mouse wheel**: Zoom
   - **Right-click**: Context menu

### Advanced Features
- **Search**: Find people by name, phone, email, or any other field
- **Filters**: Sort and group people by various criteria
- **Statistics**: View comprehensive data analytics
- **Map Integration**: Visualize addresses on maps
- **AI Analysis**: Get insights from ChatGPT (set API key first)

## Data Format

The application processes text files with structured sections:

```
=== Section Name ===
Field: Value
Field: Value
...

=== Another Section ===
